# How to Post on the Website

Our web platform has three parts to it:

  * [**Panopticon**](http://panopticon.theodi.org/) which keeps track of what content we have and enables you to create new pages
  * [**Publisher**](http://publisher.theodi.org/) which enables you to edit the content of the pages and controls their publication
  * **Front Ends** such as [theodi.org](http://theodi.org/) which display the pages; each item of content can appear in multiple front ends or appear in different contexts within a single front end

## New Posts

To create a new posts, you need to:

  1. Go to [Panopticon](http://panopticon.theodi.org/).
  2. Select [**Add artefact**](http://panopticon.theodi.org/artefacts/new) from the menu bar.
  3. Fill in the form. If you are creating a blog or news post, or a normal page, then you should select *Article* as the **Kind** of artefact. A new **Article category** field will then be displayed, allowing you to select the specific type of article.
  4. Click **Save and go to item**. This will take you to Publisher.
  5. In Publisher you will see another form which enables you to fill in additional information, including the main body of the page.
  6. At any time, **Save** and then click the **Preview** button to see what the page will look like on the final site.
  7. When you are finished editing the document, choose someone to review what you've done in the **Assigned to** field and click the **2nd pair of eyes** button. If you want to, you can add some commentary for that person to see when they review your post.
  
That's it. The person that you selected to review your post will receive an email prompting them to take a look at it (but nudging them through another channel won't hurt). If it's OK, they will publish it for you, or they might assign it back to you to amend or publish.

## Reviewing Posts

If you've received an email asking you to review a post, you should:

  1. Go to [Publisher](http://publisher.theodi.org/).
  2. Look at the [**In review**](http://publisher.theodi.org/admin?list=in_review) articles; you should be able to see the post that you are supposed to review.
  3. Click the **Edit** icon for that post.
  4. Read the post; read any notes left by the author in the **History & Notes** tab and use **Preview** if you want to see what it looks like in context. Make any minor edits that are required.
  5. Click either **Needs more work** or **OK for publication**. Either way, you can add notes or comments.
  6. If the post is OK for publication, and you are able to publish posts, then you can click **Publish**. Otherwise, assign it to someone who can publish (ie someone in the core ODI team) by selecting them from the **Assigned to** list and clicking **Save**.
  
That's all you need to do.

## Updating Posts

To edit a post, you need to create a new edition for that post:

  1. Go to [Publisher](http://publisher.theodi.org/).
  2. Look at the [**Published**](http://publisher.theodi.org/admin?list=published) articles and use the **Filter** box to filter down to the item that you're looking for. You might have to make sure that *All* is selected on the **Filter by assignee** drop-down.
  3. Select **Create new edition of this publication**. This will take you to the normal edit page.
  4. Proceed as if editing a new post. Describe what changes you made when prompted for comments.
