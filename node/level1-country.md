# ODI Node : Level 1 - A Country-level Node

An independent, non-profit organisation. A country-level Node must be a well-funded, financially sustainable organisation that sits outside of governmnet, but with strong connections into the public sector. 

Principle: similar to the founding ODI UK non-profit organisation in London

No contract draft currently exists for this Level. Pilots will use the Level 2 (City/Region) framework.
